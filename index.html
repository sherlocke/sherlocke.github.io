  <h1>Find things before you've realized what to look for</h1>
  <p>Imagine finding relevant information while researching before even realizing what to look for.</p>
  <p>Using the cognitive powers of IBM Watson, Sherlocke helps you do exactly that, all without you having to change your existing workflow.</p>

  <h1>Learns as you learn</h1>
  <p>You put pieces together as you do your research. So does Sherlocke.</p>
  <p>Sherlocke continually offers relevant documents to you, but it remembers what you've been looking at before, so it can figure out what's really important.</p>

  <p>Sherlocke for Scholars.</p>
  <p>Sherlocke for Cats. <sup>*</sup></p>
  <p>Powered by IBM Watson, Sherlocke is an intelligent research tool that integrates with any existing digital databases of documents, allowing users to efficiently find relevant information from a variety of sources, no matter what the subject is.</p>
